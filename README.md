# image_mapR

I have created a simple image mapper in R Shiny so that you can click on an image and then get a heat map of the spatial distribution of the clicked points. Enjoy!

N.B: The heat map image will only appear once you have click some points and then saved them

You can find a working version of the app <a href="https://jamiesamson.shinyapps.io/ImageMapper/">here</a>
